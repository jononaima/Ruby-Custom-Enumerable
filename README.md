# Ruby Custom Enumerable Project

This repository complements the [Custom Enumerables Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-custom-enumerables) in the Ruby Course for The Odin Project. The goal of this project was to reimplement common methods used frequently through the enumerables module with objects like arrays and hashes. The goal of the project was to familiarize with how to work with blocks and procs.
